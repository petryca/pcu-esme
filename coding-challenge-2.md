## Icons

For the social icons, you can use a font icon library. Some suggestions can be found below:

- [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/)
- [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/)

## Hints

The design is based on a simple two column responsive layout. The easiest method is to use CSS Grid. For detailed information on CSS Grid see the following page:

- [CSS Grid Layout Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

Alternatively, the layout can also be build using CSS Flexbox:

The bg-desktop.svg and bg-mobile.svg should be placed on the page as a CSS Background. More information how to use CSS Backgrounds:
